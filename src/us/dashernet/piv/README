This code is super experimental and very sloppy.  The only goal here was to
put together a quick proof of concept that it was possible to do PIV auth
to mysql and to a webserver by overriding things as much as possible
at the default java level.

I don't believe this is the way things *should* be done, but in some cases its
neccessary as the relevant libraries one would like to use to not expose
the internals of the SSL handshake in a way ammenable to configuration.
